# Sandbox

This is my personal sandbox for coding projects. My favorite framework to develop in is the [Angular](https://angular.io/) front-end framework. Although I have over a decade of enterprise experience working with Angular, this space should evolve to feature [React](https://react.dev/), [Go](https://go.dev/), and [XRPL](https://xrpl.org/introduction.html)!

## Angular Projects

1. Torcoin: Allows users to view crypto prices ranked by market cap. It's a stripped down version of [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). Users can create accounts using Firebase auth and then use their account to track favorite coins! Tech stack includes [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Nebular](https://akveo.github.io/nebular/), [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), [NGXS](https://ngxs.gitbook.io/ngxs), (Firebase Auth)[https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start], [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and the [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/). `npx nx serve torcoin`
