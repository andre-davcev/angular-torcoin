# Torcoin

This is an [Angular](https://angular.io/) sandbox project that allows users to view crypto prices ranked by market cap. It's a stripped down version of [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). Users can create accounts using Firebase auth and then use their account to track their favorite coins! The tech stack includes [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Nebular](https://akveo.github.io/nebular/), [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), [NGXS](https://ngxs.gitbook.io/ngxs), [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start), [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and the [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).
